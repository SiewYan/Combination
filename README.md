# Combination
Store the datacards used for combinations

## VH naming convention

The name of the datacard reflects the channel and mass point considered.

The first three letters define the signal type:

#### XZh: neutral Z'
#### XWh: charged W'

The following letters determine the number and flavor of the leptons in the final state:

#### nn: 0 leptons
#### en: 1 electron
#### mn: 1 muon
#### ee: 2 electrons
#### mm: 2 muons

The last one or two letters represent the number of b-tags:

#### b: 1 b-tag
#### bb: 2 b-tag

In the name does not distinguish some of the previous categories, it means that these catogories are combined. E.g.: if there is no b nor bb, the 1 and 2 b-tag channels are combined. If there is no lepton specification, all the corresponding leptonic channels are combined.


## Signal normalization

So far, all the signal samples are normalized to sigma x Br(X->VH) = 1 pb
